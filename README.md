<h1>Welcome to ZenOut!</h1>

ZenOut was created for you. When needing to change your current state of mind, turn to ZenOut's use of binaural 
beats to relax and soothe your brain or to turn your brain up to full functioning power! 

ZenOut works best with headphones and you may find that raw binaural beats may not sound too pretty. So as long as the website  stays open, the beats you create will play in the background of any music or sounds you'd like to overlay them with & still work their magic.

<h2>To Get Started:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Pop in your headphones and select your volume.</li>
<li>Use the brainwave list below the sliders to find a brainwave frequency you'd like to experience. Move the Brainwave slider to find that brainwave Hz level.</li>
<li>Find a base frequency best suits you on the final slider.</li>
<li>Pick your favorite nature sound or login into your Spotify to play music over the binaural beats.
<li>Now zenout!</li>
</ol>
